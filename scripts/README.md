# ðŸ§© Architecture â€” Data Flow Diagram
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project simulates an enterprise data integration process using two main source systems:

ðŸ§¾ ERP System â€” containing transactional and operational data

ðŸ‘¥ CRM System â€” containing customer-related data

Both sources are provided as CSV files, and the goal is to integrate, clean, and transform these raw datasets into analytical-ready tables following a three-layer architecture.
